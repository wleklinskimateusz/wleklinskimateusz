### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
TypeScript Developer with a Bachelor Degree in Applied Physics -> It says it all - I'm nuts :>

- ðŸ’» excited about Next.js and Server Components
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the beginning of the Universe (don't ask me what was before that ;D)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@m_wleklinski) or [X](https://twitter.com/wleklinskim)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Contrary to popular belief, an electron isn't blue - it has no color because it doesn't interact using the Strong Force. Proton, on the other hand, is white (combined colors of quarks inside red + green + blue)
